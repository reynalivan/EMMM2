# Epic 11: Folder Listing & Classification

## 1. Executive Summary

- **Proposed Solution**: A backend listing command (`list_mod_folders`) that performs recursive classification per folder to distinguish between containers, mod packs, and internal assets. It employs a single-pass `fs::read_dir` strategy to identify 3DMigoto project structures (ini files, .buf/.ib/.dds assets), calculates folder sizes and modified timestamps, and normalizes display names by stripping "DISABLED " prefixes. It also detects "naming conflicts" and **inherited disabled states** (scanning path segments for parent prefixes). It now includes a **warnings scan** (e.g., detecting 0KB corrupt INIs) during classification.
- **Success Criteria**:
  - [x] Command returns in ≤ 200ms for 500 top-level folders on an SSD.
  - [x] Correctly identifies `ModPackRoot` (has ini + mod sections).
  - [x] Strips `DISABLED ` prefix variants (`dis-`, `disable_`, `dis_`) from display names.
  - [x] Identifies "InternalAssets" (folders referenced by `filename=` in a parent mod's INI).
  - [x] Returns `classification_reasons` and **`warnings`** for every node.
  - [x] Detects `EnabledDisabledBothPresent` conflicts.
  - [x] **Path-based Inheritance**: Identifies if a folder is locked by a `DISABLED ` parent ancestor in $O(\text{depth})$.
  - Incremental classification skips cache-valid entries — re-scan time ≤ 20ms when ≤ 5% of entries have changed mtime/size.
  - `.ini` files without any `TextureOverride*`, `ShaderOverride*`, or `Resource*` sections are never falsely classified as `ModPackRoot`.
  - Malformed `info.json` isolates parse failure without breaking the rest of the directory listing.
  - Path traversal attempts (sub_path escaping `mods_path`) are blocked 100% of the time — verified by unit test.

## 2. User Experience & Functionality

### User Stories

#### US-11.1: List Folder Contents

As a user, I want the app to read my mods directory, so that I can see all my installed mods in the grid.

| ID        | Type        | Criteria                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| --------- | ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| AC-11.1.1 | ✅ Positive | Given an active game with a valid `mods_path`, when `list_folders` is invoked with `sub_path = ""` (root level), then all immediate top-level object folder entries are returned as a flat array in ≤ 200ms |
| AC-11.1.2 | ✅ Positive | Given `sub_path = "Characters/Albedo"`, when invoked, then only the mod folders immediately inside that path are returned — not recursive grandchildren                                                     |
| AC-11.1.3 | ❌ Negative | Given a `mods_path` that no longer exists on disk, when `list_folders` is called, then an `IO: NotFound` error is returned — not a Rust panic, and the frontend shows a "Path not found" banner             |
| AC-11.1.4 | ⚠️ Edge     | Given a directory with ≥ 10,000 sub-folders, then `list_folders` returns results without panic or OOM — using `rayon` parallel iteration with bounded memory; result may be paginated at ≥ 500 items        |

---

#### US-11.2: Normalization & Classification of `DISABLED` Prefix

As a system, I want raw folder names to be parsed so `DISABLED ` prefix is stripped and reflected as `is_enabled = false`, so the UI shows clean display names to users.

| ID        | Type        | Criteria                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| --------- | ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| AC-11.2.1 | ✅ Positive | Given a folder named `DISABLED My Skin`, when listed, then `is_enabled = false` and `name = "My Skin"` in the returned `FolderEntry`                                                                                                   |
| AC-11.2.2 | ✅ Positive | Given a folder named `My Skin`, when listed, then `is_enabled = true` and `name = "My Skin"`                                                                                                                                           |
| AC-11.2.3 | ❌ Negative | Given a folder named `DISABLED DISABLED Skin`, the normalization engine strips all leading `DISABLED ` prefixes until none remain — resulting in `name = "Skin"` and `is_enabled = false` — no partial prefix left in the display name |
| AC-11.2.4 | ⚠️ Edge     | Given a folder named exactly `DISABLED` (empty name after prefix strip), the system falls back to `name = "(Unnamed Mod)"` placeholder — not an empty string or null                                                                   |

#### US-11.3: Recursive Folder Classification

As a system, I want to classify folders into their correct types so the UI can decide whether to show a navigable folder (ContainerFolder) or a terminal mod card (ModPackRoot/VariantContainer).

| ID        | Type        | Criteria                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| --------- | ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| AC-11.3.1 | ✅ Positive | Given a folder with no `.ini` or asset files at any depth ≤ 5, then it is classified as `ContainerFolder` — double-clicking navigates inside                                                                                                                            |
| AC-11.3.2 | ✅ Positive | Given a folder containing ≥ 1 valid mod `.ini` at folder root **AND** typical mod assets (`.buf`, `.ib`, `.dds`, `.vb`, `.hlsl`) above a threshold (≥ 2 asset files), then it is classified as `ModPackRoot`                                                            |
| AC-11.3.3 | ✅ Positive | Given a folder whose root `.ini` references multiple sub-folders via `filename=` paths, then it is classified as `VariantContainer` — its `variants[]` is populated from subfolders that each contain a valid mod `.ini`                                                |
| AC-11.3.4 | ✅ Positive | Given a subfolder named `Hat` that is referenced via `filename=./Hat/...` inside a parent's `Resource*` or `CustomShader*` section, then `Hat` is classified as `InternalAssets` — hidden from the grid (not returned in the listing)                                   |
| AC-11.3.5 | ✅ Positive | Given a folder with ≥ 5 sibling subfolders each containing their own valid mod `.ini`, it is classified as `VariantContainer` even without an orchestrator ini                                                                                                          |
| AC-11.3.6 | ❌ Negative | Given a folder containing a `.ini` file with **no** `TextureOverride*`, `ShaderOverride*`, or `Resource*` sections, then the folder is **not** classified as `ModPackRoot` on `.ini` presence alone — it remains `ContainerFolder`                                      |
| AC-11.3.7 | ❌ Negative | Given a symlink creating an infinite loop, the classifier stops at depth 5 and logs `CyclicalSymlink` error without freezing — the parent folder is still returned as `ContainerFolder`                                                                                 |
| AC-11.3.8 | ⚠️ Edge     | Given a folder that qualifies for both `ModPackRoot` and `VariantContainer` (has local `.ini` AND variant subdirs with `.ini`), then `ModPackRoot` takes priority — deterministic classification priority: `ModPackRoot > VariantContainer > ContainerFolder`           |
| AC-11.3.9 | ⚠️ Edge     | Given a `ModPackRoot` folder whose root `.ini` references `./Preset_A/` and `./Preset_B/` via `filename=`, both subfolders are listed as `InternalAssets` — they do NOT appear as `VariantContainer` children unless they each independently contain a valid mod `.ini` |

---

#### US-11.4: Incremental Classification Cache

As a system, I want folder classification to be cached and only recomputed when files change, so that repeated `list_folders` calls don't re-scan unchanged directories.

| ID        | Type        | Criteria                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| --------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| AC-11.4.1 | ✅ Positive | Given a second call to `list_folders` for the same path within the same session, when no entry has changed `mtime` or `size`, then classification results are served from the in-memory cache in ≤ 20ms — no `.ini` re-parsing |
| AC-11.4.2 | ✅ Positive | Given 1 out of 100 entries has a changed `mtime`, then only that entry is re-classified; the other 99 are served from cache                                                                                                    |
| AC-11.4.3 | ❌ Negative | Given a folder is deleted externally between two `list_folders` calls, then the stale cache entry is evicted; the deleted folder does not appear in the results                                                                |
| AC-11.4.4 | ⚠️ Edge     | Given a `.ini` is modified inside a `ModPackRoot` (changing `filename=` references), then the cache key (mtime/size of the folder's content) changes — the folder is re-classified from scratch                                |

---

#### US-11.5: Metadata Enrichment

As a system, I want each listed folder to carry its `info.json` fields and thumbnail path, so the UI can render rich mod cards without additional round-trips.

| ID        | Type        | Criteria                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| --------- | ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| AC-11.1.1 | ✅ Positive | A folder is `ModPackRoot` if it contains a `.ini` file with valid 3DMigoto sections (`[TextureOverride...]`, etc.) AND has meaningful subfolders or assets. |
| AC-11.1.2 | ✅ Positive | A folder is `FlatModRoot` if it is a `ModPackRoot` but its children are ONLY internal assets (referenced by INI). |
| AC-11.1.3 | ✅ Positive | A folder is `VariantContainer` if it contains 3+ subfolders each containing a mod INI, or 2+ subfolders if a parent INI references them. |
| AC-11.1.4 | ✅ Positive | A folder is `InternalAssets` if it is referenced by a `filename=` directive in a parent INI.                                                                                              |
| AC-11.1.5 | ✅ Positive | A folder is `ContainerFolder` if it does not meet mod criteria (general categorization folder).                                                                                           |
| AC-11.5.1 | ✅ Positive | Given a folder containing `info.json`, when listed, then `author`, `description`, `version`, and `link` from the JSON are attached to the `FolderEntry` response                          |
| AC-11.5.2 | ✅ Positive | Given a folder containing `preview.png` or `preview.jpg`, when listed, then `thumbnail_path` is set to the absolute path — the frontend converts via `convertFileSrc()`                   |
| AC-11.5.3 | ❌ Negative | Given a folder with no `info.json`, then `metadata` fields are `null` in the response — the grid renders without author/description but does not crash                                    |
| AC-11.5.4 | ⚠️ Edge     | Given a malformed (invalid JSON) `info.json`, then the parse error is logged at `warn` level, the metadata fields are `null`, but the rest of the folder entry is still returned normally |
| AC-11.5.5 | ✅ Positive | Given a folder contains a 0 KB root `.ini`, classification still determines its node type (`FlatModRoot`, `ModPackRoot`, or `VariantContainer`) where possible, while adding a warning entry describing the corrupt `.ini`. |
| AC-11.5.6 | ✅ Positive | Downstream consumers such as Collections Preview may persist and reuse the resolved terminal folder type + warning metadata from this classification layer instead of re-inferring it purely from raw paths. |

---

### Non-Goals

- Folder listing never recurses deeper than 5 levels regardless of folder depth.
- No watching or polling in this command — that is Epic 28 (File Watcher).
- No thumbnail generation in this command — only path resolution; generation is Epic 41.
- `InternalAssets` classified folders are excluded from the returned listing but are never deleted from disk.
- No dynamic re-classification at runtime; the cache is invalidated per-entry by `mtime`/`size` change only.

### Integration Points

| Component               | Detail                                                                                                     |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Path Guard              | `std::fs::canonicalize(mods_path + sub_path)` → `starts_with(mods_path)` check — rejects traversal         |
| Classification Cache    | `Arc<RwLock<HashMap<(PathBuf, SystemTime, u64), FolderType>>>` — keyed by path + mtime + size              |
| INI Validity Check      | Scan only `TextureOverride*`, `ShaderOverride*`, `Resource*` section headers — line-by-line, no full parse |
| `referenced_subfolders` | Parsed from `filename=` values in `Resource*` and `CustomShader*` sections only                            |
| Parallelism             | `rayon::par_iter` for entry processing — `max_threads = Rayon default (num_cpus)`                          |
| React Query Key         | `['mod-folders', modsPath, subPath, safeMode]` — invalidated by Disk Reconcile results (Epic 28)          |
| Thumbnail               | Path stored in `FolderEntry`; frontend converts with `convertFileSrc()` from `@tauri-apps/api`             |

### Security & Privacy

- **Directory traversal prevention**: `sub_path` is joined with `mods_path` and immediately `canonicalize()`d; the result is checked with `.starts_with(&mods_path_canonical)` — any path escaping the root is rejected with `PathEscapeError`.
- **Symlink depth limit**: Classifier stops recursion at depth 5 regardless of symlinks — prevents DoS via crafted link chains.
- **`info.json` is read-only** — listing never writes metadata; JSON parse errors are isolated per entry and logged, not propagated.
- **INI validation limited to section headers** — no arbitrary code evaluation; only string pattern matching for `[TextureOverride`, `[ShaderOverride`, `[Resource`.
- **Safe Mode**: If `safe_mode = true`, folders with `is_safe = false` in their linked `info.json` are excluded from the returned `Vec` — never reaching the frontend.

## 4. Dependencies

- **Blocked by**: Epic 01 (App Bootstrap — DB), Epic 02 (Game Management — `mods_path`), Epic 09 (Object Schema — classifier uses INI detection logic).
- **Blocks**: Epic 12 (Folder Grid UI — renders the `Vec<FolderEntry>`), Epic 28 (File Watcher / Disk Reconcile — invalidates `['mod-folders']`), Epic 41 (Thumbnail System — reads `thumbnail_path`).
